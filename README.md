# 👋 Hi, I'm NightPulse

I'm a self-taught developer building **AI-powered systems and productivity tools**
on **low-end hardware**.

🧠 Inspired by ChatGPT  
📱 Built on Redmi 9A & old laptops  
🚀 Focused on AI companions, memory-based systems, and smart workflows  

I believe great software is about **understanding people**, not just code.
